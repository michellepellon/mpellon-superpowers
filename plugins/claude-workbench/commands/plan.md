Create an implementation plan for the provided input.

## Input

$ARGUMENTS

If no input provided, look for a spec or design document in the current directory.

## Process

1. **Understand**: Read and analyze the input thoroughly
2. **Break down**: Decompose into small, iterative chunks that build on each other
3. **Right-size**: Ensure steps are small enough to implement safely, big enough to make progress
4. **Sequence**: Order so each step integrates with previous work (no orphaned code)
5. **Review**: Iterate on the breakdown until steps feel right-sized

## Output

Write the plan to `plan.md` with:

- Overview of the approach
- Numbered steps with clear scope
- Dependencies between steps noted
- Acceptance criteria for each step
