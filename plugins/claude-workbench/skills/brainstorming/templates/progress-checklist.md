# Brainstorming Progress Checklist

Use this checklist to track progress through the brainstorming workflow:

```
Brainstorming Progress:
- [ ] Phase 1: Understanding (purpose, constraints, criteria gathered)
- [ ] Phase 2: Exploration (2-3 approaches proposed and evaluated)
- [ ] Phase 3: Design Presentation (design validated in sections)
- [ ] Phase 4: Design Documentation (design written to docs/plans/)
- [ ] Phase 5: Worktree Setup (if implementing)
- [ ] Phase 6: Planning Handoff (if implementing)
```

## Notes

- Copy this checklist at the start of brainstorming session
- Check off each phase as completed
- It's okay to go backward when needed (see SKILL.md "When to Revisit")
- Phases 5-6 only apply when proceeding to implementation
